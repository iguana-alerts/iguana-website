                                            <li>This issue is on Apple's end, as it takes a second for iOS to
                                                reconfigure your device's audio for recording in addition to playback.
                                                Other apps have the same issue, and unfortunately there's
                                                not much we can do about it.</li>

                                                    music, you'll be able to hear it in your video.</li>

                                                    reasons. If an app could listen in on the music playing from another
                                                    app, it could also eavesdrop on anthing else you're listening to!

                                                    this reason, Apple does not allow it.</li>

                                                    requires that you have an audio file of the music you want to use.

                                            <li>Make sure you've given Mideo permission to save to the Photos app: go to
                                                the Settings app, scroll down to Mideo, and make sure the app is allowed
                                                to add to Photos.</li>
                                            <li>Quit Mideo (open the app switcher and swipe up on Mideo) then reopen it.
                                                When it opens, Mideo will export any videos that previously failed to
                                                save.</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>By default, Mideo uses your device's built-in microphone.</li>
                                            <li>If you connect an external microphone or wired headphones with a
                                                built-in mic, Mideo will use that as the input.</li>
                                            <li>If you connect wireless headphones, Mideo will still use your device's
                                                built-in mic. Because of the limited bandwidth of Bluetooth, using the
                                                mic built into wireless headphones would significantly decrease the
                                                sound quality and we want to avoid that.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h6 class="bold">What does "Available Space: 12 hours of 4K video" mean?</h6>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>This tells you how much available storage is remaining on your device in
                                                terms of how much video you can record.</li>
                                            <li>To manage the storage on your device, open the Settings app and go to
                                                General -> iPhone Storage (or iPad Storage)</li>
                                            <li>You can record more video if you select a lower resolution. For example,
                                                1080p video takes up about 1/4 the space of a 4K video of the same
                                                length. However, this is at the cost of video quality.</li>

                                            <li>We changed how the app saves videos, so you should no longer have issues
                                                with Mideo taking up excess space because of the cache.</li>
                                            <li>However, some users have had issues with the old cache not clearing
                                                automatically when updating from older versions. Please delete and
                                                reinstall Mideo, which should fix the problem for good.</li>
