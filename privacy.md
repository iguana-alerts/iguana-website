Topanga Technologies built the Mideo app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Topanga Technologies, LLC and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, and for remote debugging, Mideo may retain information about your device and how you use the app in a cloud database. Mideo does not store any videos in the cloud, even for debugging purposes - every video taken by a user is only viewable on the device they take the video on. Again, the developers of this app do not have the ability to see your videos even if they wanted, since the videos are taken, stored, and viewed only on the device.

## Security
Since videos are taken, stored, and viewed on your iOS device, and iOS devices are quite secure, you can be assured of the security of Mideo.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete their data from any data servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
