title: Terms of Use
---
These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Mideo application (“Mideo” or “Application”) operated by Topanga Technologies, LLC (“Topanga Technologies”, “us”, or “we”).

By accessing and using Mideo, you (“User”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the [Privacy Policy](/privacy). If you do not accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Services. We may modify these Terms and the Privacy Policy at any time and such modification will be effective upon posting to the Application.

## Privacy
Topanga Technologies takes your privacy seriously. For a better experience, and for remote debugging, Mideo may retain information about your device and how you use the app in a cloud database. By using the Application, you agree that Topanga Technologies may collect and use this information as set forth in the Privacy Policy.

## Subscriptions
Some parts of the Application are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

Your Subscription will be charged to your App Store account at confirmation of purchase. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of your Subscription period unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

You can manage your Subscription or turn off auto-renewal at any time from your App Store account settings. Cancellation of the active Subscription period is not allowed.

All Subscriptions may be final and non-refundable. By accepting these terms, you agree that Topanga Technologies is not required to provide a refund for any reason.
Topanga Technologies may change, modify, or eliminate features of the Subscription at any time, with or without notice.

## Subscription Fee Changes
Topanga Technologies, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will not go into effect automatically; you must opt into the fee change to continue using the Subscription after the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

## Third-Party Websites
Mideo may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Topanga Technologies.

Topanga Technologies has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. 

You further acknowledge and agree that Topanga Technologies shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
